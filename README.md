# cellsalive
An online version of the now deprecated Cells Alive site. I do NOT own any of the content of this website. It is ony for educational purposes.
This site was revived by Ari Pouratian '30. If you're reading this, you probably are in the wrong place. Click [here]([url](https://thatoneweirddev.github.io/cellsalive/cellsalive_files/index.htm)) for the website.
